# 🧪 **Supabase Integration Test**

## ✅ **What We've Fixed**

1. **Database Schema**: Created all necessary tables (`users`, `habits`, `habit_entries`, `skills`, `skill_sessions`)
2. **RLS Policies**: Configured Row Level Security policies to allow users to:
   - Insert their own profile during signup
   - View, update, and delete their own data
   - Access their habits, skills, and related entries
3. **Authentication Flow**: Updated AuthContext to handle user creation properly

## 🚀 **Test the App**

### **Step 1: Sign Up**
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click "Sign Up" if you see the login form
3. Enter:
   - **Name**: Your name
   - **Email**: Your email address
   - **Password**: A secure password
4. Click "Sign Up"

### **Step 2: Verify Authentication**
- You should be redirected to the main dashboard
- The sidebar should show your navigation options
- No more authentication errors in the console

### **Step 3: Test Data Creation**
1. Click "Add New Habit" in the sidebar
2. Fill out the habit form and submit
3. Click "Add New Skill" in the sidebar
4. Fill out the skill form and submit
5. Check if the data appears on the dashboard

## 🔍 **Check Console**
Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12) and check the Console tab:
- ✅ No more "401 Unauthorized" errors
- ✅ No more "RLS policy violation" errors
- ✅ User profile should be created successfully

## 🎯 **Expected Results**
- ✅ User can sign up and log in
- ✅ User profile is created in Supabase
- ✅ User can create habits and skills
- ✅ Data persists between sessions
- ✅ All RLS policies work correctly

## 🐛 **If You Still See Errors**
1. Check the Supabase dashboard to see if the user was created
2. Verify the RLS policies are active
3. Check the browser console for any remaining errors
4. Make sure you're using the correct Supabase URL and keys
